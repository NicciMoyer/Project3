# School Box

## This is an application which organized clases for students and teachers. Teachers can add classes and assignments, and add notes and update grades, while students can view a summary of their grades for each class and their grades for individual assignments.

## usage:

Create an account as a student or a teacher using the signup page. A student account is read-only, you will see a dashboard displaying your classes and grades. A teacher account will have the ability to create new classes, create new assignments and add/edit grades. 

Teacher:

Upon logging in, you will be directed to the teacher dashboard.

Use the form in the middle to create a new class or click the cards on the right to view existing classes.

Clicking these will take you to a class page.

The navigation bar on the left can take you to your other classes pages. The middle column displays your existing assignments and contains a form to add a new assignment. On the right, your students are listed and the dropdown contains all students not in the class. Students can be added with the Add Student button. 

Click on the assignments to navigate to the assignment pages.

The nav bar on the left has all assignments for the selected class. The form in the middle can be used to edit the assignment details, and the forms on the right can be used to edit grades. If grades have already been submitted, they will show the current grades, otherwise they will show assigned for the status, 0 for the grade and the notes will be blank.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
